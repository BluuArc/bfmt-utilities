* The `app.js` file contains the logic for hooking up the button, checkbox, and dropdown as well as fetching the data and using the `bfmt-utilities` library to display effect data for a chosen unit.
* The `index.html` file contains the markup that you see on this page. It also imports both `bfmt-utilities` and `app.js` into the browser.
